## dplyr

dplyr provides a set of tools to assemble, transform and summarize your data. 


## Single table verbs

`dplyr` implements the following verbs useful for data manipulation:

* `select()`: focus on a subset of variables
* `filter()`: focus on a subset of rows
* `mutate()`: add new columns
* `summarise()`: reduce each group to a smaller number of summary statistics
* `arrange()`: re-order the rows

## Multiple table verbs

As well as verbs that work on a single tbl, there are also a set of useful verbs that work with two tbls at a time: joins and set operations.

dplyr implements the four most useful joins from SQL:

* `inner_join(x, y)`: matching x + y
* `left_join(x, y)`: all x + matching y
* `semi_join(x, y)`: all x with match in y
* `anti_join(x, y)`: all x without match in y

And provides methods for:

* `intersect(x, y)`: all rows in both x and y
* `union(x, y)`: rows in either x or y
* `setdiff(x, y)`: rows in x, but not y

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
